========

Contains useful scripts for genomics.

EMBLtoPROT.pl - Extracts protein and mRNA sequences from EMBL files.
EMBLtoTBL.pl - Converts EMBL files to NCBI TBL files for TBL2ASN.
FASTQtoFASTA.pl - Converts FASTQ files to FASTA files and their associated QUAL files. Autodetects Sanger/illumina encoding.
removeTP.pl - Removes NexteraXT transposon sequences from FASTQ files.
SeqIO.pl - Interconverts common formats. Based on BioPerl's SeqIO module. Requires local installation of BioPerl.
SFFtoFASTA.pl - Converts SSF files to FASTA format. Requires SFFINFO from the gsAssembler suite.
SFFtoFASTQ.pl - Converts SSF files to FASTQ format. Requires SFFINFO from the gsAssembler suite.
splitMultifasta - Splits a multifasta file into separate fasta (*.fsa) files
sort_by_coverage.pl - Filters the Contigs.tsv file generated by Ray according to the desired coverage range and minimum length.
SSRG.pl - Synthetic Short Read Generator. Generates synthetic short reads in Fastq (Q33) format from multifasta files. Useful for SNP calling.
